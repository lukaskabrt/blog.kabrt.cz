Title: About Me
ShowInFooter: false
---
I am a software developer, outdoor enthusiast, runner, skier, climber and an amateur photographer.

## Software developer
I started with programming as a child on the old Atari XE computer because it seemed like an amazing adventure and 20 years later I still feel the same.

I have tried various programming languages, the traditional ones - BASIC, Pascal, C++, Java, as well as the more exotic ones - LISP, Prolog but my programming language of choice is C# which I have been following since the introduction of .NET 2.0.

Right now my focus is on web development and cloud technologies.

## Outdoor

You know that feeling, right?
